# Transfer Learning

Transfer learning is especially powerful when you do not have a large and varied dataset. In this case, a model trained from scratch would likely memorize the training data quickly, but not be able to generalize well to new data. With transfer learning, you can increase your chances of training an accurate and robust model on a small dataset.

## Objectives

* Prepare a pretrained model for transfer learning
* Perform transfer learning with your own small dataset on a pretrained model
* Further fine tune the model for even better performance
